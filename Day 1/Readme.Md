# Difference Between AI, ML, and DL

- **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
- **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of Machine Learning (ML).

## Definitions

1. **AI (Artificial Intelligence):**
   - A branch of computer science focused on building intelligent machines.
2. **ML (Machine Learning):**

   - A branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn without explicit programming.

3. **DL (Deep Learning):**
   - A subfield of machine learning that utilizes neural networks with multiple layers to model complex relationships in data.

# Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning:** In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained using labeled data. The model learns to map inputs to corresponding outputs based on the provided examples.
2. **Unsupervised Learning:** In unsupervised learning, the algorithm learns from unlabeled data. The model finds patterns and relationships in the data without explicit guidance.
3. **Reinforcement Learning:** Reinforcement learning involves an agent that receives feedback from the environment based on its actions. The agent learns by iterating and improving its actions to maximize rewards.

# Tyes of Supervised Learning

1. **Regression:** Predicting a continuous numeric value.
2. **Classification:** Predicting a categorical outcome.

# Algorithms

- 1. ## Classification
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors:**
  - **Decision Tree:**
  - **Random Forest:**
- 2. ## Regression
  - **Logistic Regression:**
  - **Polynomial Regression:**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM):**

# Types of Unsupervised Learning

1. **Clustering:** Grouping data points based on similarity.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of features while preserving important information.
3. **Association Rules:** Discovering patterns in data.
